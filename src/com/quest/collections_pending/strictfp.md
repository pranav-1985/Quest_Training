# `strictfp` Keyword in Java

### Definition:
The `strictfp` keyword in Java is used to restrict floating-point calculations to ensure that they are consistent across different platforms. When a class, method, or interface is declared with the `strictfp` keyword, it enforces a standard set of rules for floating-point arithmetic to be followed, making sure that the results of floating-point calculations are the same, irrespective of the underlying platform or architecture.

### Why `strictfp` is Used:
The main reason to use `strictfp` is to ensure **portability** of floating-point calculations across different platforms. By default, Java allows platform-dependent behavior for floating-point calculations, which can lead to inconsistencies in calculations when running on different machines. The `strictfp` keyword removes this variability by enforcing the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point operations.

## Where `strictfp` Can Be Used:
1. **Class Level**: When applied to a class, it affects all the methods and inner classes within that class.
2. **Method Level**: When applied to a method, it affects only that specific method's floating-point calculations.
3. **Interface Level**: When applied to an interface, it affects all the methods in that interface.

## Example: `strictfp` at the Class Level

```java
strictfp class MyClass {
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double multiply(double a, double b) {
        return a * b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        System.out.println(obj.add(1.1, 2.2));  // Output will be consistent across platforms
        System.out.println(obj.multiply(3.5, 2.0));  // Output will be consistent across platforms
    }
}
